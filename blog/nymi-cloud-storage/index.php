    <h5 id="txt2">We love free things, even more if they're online because you don't have to pick them up, but what we love even more than free online things is... TACOS! (we're kidding, we do love tacos though.) But what we do love more than free online stuff is free cloud storage, we love cloud storage because it allows us to transfer all of our documents between devices with ease, which makes life easier if you don't have time to connect your phone to your computer and sync all of your photos and documents, our storage system has no compression so the resolution that you upload your photos in will be the same resolution that you view and download your photos in.</h5>


    <h5 id="txt2">While our system may not be as robust as Google Drive, or AWS S3, we can promise one thing they can't: open-source code. The code being open source allows the community to find bugs faster, make the program more secure, and allows faster updates and bug fixes. Currently all of our projects are open-source, and we plan for them to stay that way, which makes us transparent and secure beacuse you can see the code running on our servers, so you can be assured we are not doing anything malicious with your data.</h5>

    <h5 id="txt2">Because our code is open source you can self host your own cloud storage, and because of that you can modify it to your own taste and make it more secure, such as limiting the IP addresses of computers that can access your website and adding other authentification methods. If you're hosting on AWS take a look at <a class="text-reset" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-block-or-allow-ips/">this article</a>. We also will be highly active on the GitHub repository, so if you or anyone you know has any additions to Nymi that you think would benefit the community feel free to email us your code.</h5>

    <h5 id="txt2">Don't worry, our service may be free but you can donate to receive extra perks (when we release), such as 150GB of storage, and a cool role in our <a class="text-reset" href="https://discord.gg/ErPWf4JsVc">Discord server</a>.</h5>
