<h1 class="center" id="txt3">Nothing is free</h1>
<h5 class="center" id="txt2">Here at Eglo we want to provide free cloud storage for all, without the limits, in current times, 15GB won't get you far, which is why we are are giving 50GB of free storage to everyone, but there is always a catch, right? You're not wrong, the only catch is ads, we display ads on the upload page and other pages, these ads are unobtrusive and are only there so we can provide the best storage for free.</h5>
<h1 class="center" id="txt3">Privacy</h1>
<h5 class="center" id="txt2">We get it, ads suck, what sucks even more is companies selling your data, especially ad data, do you really want ads based off of your (questionable) search history? We don't either, which is why you have the option to disable targeted ads on our site, or, even better, you can get rid of ads for free by self hosting Nymi, you can view the tutorial <a class="text-reset" href="https://github.com/EgloDevelopment/Nymi/blob/main/README.md">here</a>.</h5>
<h1 class="center" id="txt3">Security</h1>
<h5 class="center" id="txt2">We too, are paranoid about our data getting into the wrong hands, so we completely get it if you don't want us to store your data, we will admit, your data is not encrypted, but it cannot be accessed without permission by other people, only specific computers are allowed to access our data server, anything else will get rejected, so you don't have to worry about data breaches, if there ever is a data breach, large or small, we will secure all accounts and change all of the passwords and id's, don't worry though, you will still be able to access your account, you just need to request a password reset from the login page and we will send you your new password. Same goes if someone hacks your account, just <a class="text-reset" href="https://eglo.pw/contact">send us an email</a> and we will help you get your account back.</h5>
